# Python - Object-relational mapping

In this project, I learned about how object-relational mapping is used for
database scripting. I became familiar with using MySQLdb and SQLAlchemy to
query, create, edit, and delete tables in MySQL.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of SQL and Python scripts for setting up test tables
for all files. Provided by ALX.

## Tasks :page_with_curl:

* **0. Get all states**
  * [0-select_states.py](./0-select_states.py): Python script that uses MySQLdb
  to list all states in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
  * Usage: `./0-select_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password>
  <database name>`.
  * Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.

* **1. Filter states**
  * [1-filter_states.py](./1-filter_states.py): Python script that uses MySQLdb
  to list all states with names starting with `N` in the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
  * Usage: `./1-filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password>
  <database name>`.
  * Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.

* **2. Filter states by user input**
  * [2-my_filter_states.py](./2-my_filter_states.py): Python script that uses
  MySQLdb to display all values matching a given name in the `states` table of
  the database `hbtn_0e_0_usa`.
  * Usage: `./2-my_filter_states.py <mysql username> <mysql password>
  <database name> <state name searched>`.
  * Results are ordered by ascending `states.id`.
  * Uses string formatting to construct the SQL query.
